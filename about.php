				<div style="font-size:12px;">
				<p>Courier companies need a program to track customers that request a delivery, details about the package, and who will be delivering the package to the recipient. The central person responsible for a smooth transaction is the operations manager or dispatcher. In the 'old days', this was done on a chalk board or white board. Now shipments show up on a single screen, making it easier to follow up on the deliveries.</p>
				<p>Each shipment typically is assigned a waybill number. Often multiple waybills (packages) are consolidated and shipped by a common carrier (truck, airline, ocean vessel). These waybills travel under one Master Waybill Number. A delivery agent is responsible for breaking apart the consolidation and getting each packages delivered. The software program should simplify the consolidation of these shipments.</p>
				<p>Modern courier software allows customers to place and track orders from the Courier's web site. 'Track and trace' is the term for getting status information on a delivery. The proof of delivery (POD) is sent in the main office by the messenger, driver, or delivery agent either by phone, fax, or electronically.</p>
				<p>Messengers and drivers need to communicate with the main office dispatcher. This used to be done by two-way radio or cell phone. Today there are several options available to courier companies which allow drivers to access the main office data via smartphone browser, or phone applications.</p>
